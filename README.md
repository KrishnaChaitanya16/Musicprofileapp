## Note
- There will be an image shown in the camera preview section, if you run on an emulator . That is because the emulator doesn't have the access to camera .

- The file picker in the HostJam , Schedule Jam , Create Post sections needs storage permissions to work properly.

- and also to test the Live Jam feature you need to run this app on a mobile instead of emulator .
